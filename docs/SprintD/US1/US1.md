# US 1 - Access the application to view the results of the tests I have performed


## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a client, I want to access the application to view the results of the tests I have performed

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**_From the Specifications Document_**

"Once the laboratory coordinator confirms that everything was done correctly, the client receives a notification alerting that the
results are already available in the central application and informing that he/she must access the application to view those results."

**_From the client clarifications_**
* Q: In US01 which date should be used to arrange the tests in order?The date the test is done or the validation date?
    * A: The test registration date.

* Q: What are the data to show the customer? and in what way do we have to show? do you have any examples you can give us?
    * A: I want to access the application to view the results of the tests I have performed. This includes the report made by the specialist doctor. The client tests must be shown ordered from the most recent to the oldest one. The test results are shown only after the client has selected a test.

* Q: My group is assuming that the client only wants to see the validated tests. Do you want to see tests in other states and if that's the case say the state of the test and show only the information available for that state?
    * A: The client should only see tests that have already been validated.
	
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* AC1: The client tests must be shown ordered from the most recent to the oldest one. 

* AC2: The test results are shown only after the client has selected a test.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

For this user story to work, the registered client must exist. That client will have to take the test and then the test has to go through the remaining procedures. Thus, the client will be able to see the results of a test that is already complete.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- Input Data
	- Typed data: introduce a test´s nhs code to wiew his results
	- Selected data: chooses a complete test.
- Output Data
	- (In)Success of the operation


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

![US1-SSD](US1-SSD.svg)


### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

The client will only be able to see their results if their tests are already completed.


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.* 

![US1-DM](US1-DM.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Starts by searching complete tests | ... interacting with the actor? | ViewClientControllerUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.  
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | ViewClientController | Controller                             |	
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new RegisterClientStore? | Company | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Company has a Store. |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Client by Email? | RegisterClientStore| IE: knows Client |
| 			  		 |	... who knows the lst complete of tests made bye client? | Client| IE: knows its own data |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new TestStore? | Company | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Company has a Store. |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Test by Code? | TestStore| IE: knows test |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a AuthFacade? | Company | Company knows the user who is using now the system |
| Step 2: Show a list of complete tests| ... knowing the tests?| TestMapper | By the application of the Creator (R1) it would be the "Company". But, by applying HC + LC to the "Company", this delegates that responsibility to the "TestStore" |
| Step 3: choose a test |.... record the choice?					 |ViewClientUI          | n/a                             |
| 			  		 |	... finding the test based in nhsCode | testStore | IE: knows test |  
| 			  		 |	... finding the Results based in the Test | Test | IE: knows results |  
| 			  		 |	... finding the Report based in the Test | Test | IE: knows report |  
| Step 4: Show the results for this test | n/a | n/a | n/a |
                                    


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * Test
 * Client

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * ViewClientResultsUI  
 * ViewClientResultsController
 * testStore
 * RegisterClientStore

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US1-SD](US1-SD.svg)

![SD_TestMapper_toDTOCompleteTest_list-SD](SD_TestMapper_toDTOCompleteTest_list.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US1-CD](US1-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**Test 1:** get a list of test complete
```java
   @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void getLstTesComplete(){
        List<app.domain.model.Test> lstTests = new ArrayList<>();
        Client cl = new Client("J","1234567890123456","30/18/2001","1234567890","1234567890","contribute@geeksforgeeks.org","12345678901","Female");
        app.domain.model.Test t = new app.domain.model.Test("2345", new Date(), new Date(), new Date());
        t.setClient(cl);
        app.domain.model.Test t2 = new app.domain.model.Test("2345", new Date(), new Date(), new Date());
        t2.setClient(cl);
        app.domain.model.Test t3 = new app.domain.model.Test("2345", new Date(), new Date(), new Date());
        t3.setClient(cl);
        lstTests.add(t);
        lstTests.add(t2);
        lstTests.add(t3);

        assertEquals(lstTests, cl.getLstTestComplete());
    }

```

**Test 2:** compare date between two tests
```java
    @Test
    public void testCompareTo(){
        Date d = new Date();
        Date d2 = new Date();
        assertEquals(0, d.compareTo(d2));
    }

```

**Test 3:** compare time between two tests
```java
    @Test
    public void testCompareTo(){
        Time t = new Time();
        Time t2 = new Time();
        assertEquals(0, t.compareTo(t2));

    }

```

**Test 4:** test of check if the words passing a limit, which is 400 words


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*
