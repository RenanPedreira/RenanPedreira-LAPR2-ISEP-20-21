# US 8 - Register a new clinical analysis laboratory stating which kind of test(s) it operates

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an administrator, I want to register a new clinical  analysis laboratory stating which kind of test(s) it operates.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*

**_From the Specifications Document_**

“Many Labs has a network of clinical analysis laboratories in England where analysis of blood(samples are collected)are performed, as well as Covid-19 tests. All Many Labs clinical analysis laboratories perform clinical blood tests,and a subset of these laboratories also performs Covid-19 tests. To register a clinical analisis laboratory , the administrator needs laboratory Id, name, address, phone number and TIN number and needs to stat which kind of test(s) it operates.”

**_From the client clarifications_**

*Question: "What kind of atributes does Clinical Analysis Laboratory has?"

*Answer: "Each Clinical Analysis Laboratory is characterized by the following attributes:
          
Laboratory ID;
Name;
Address;
Phone Number;
TIN number."
     

*Question: "Are two Clinical Analysis Laboratories with the same:
a) Laboratory ID OR 
b) name OR
c) address OR
d) phone Number OR
e) TIN number

allowed to exist?

In other words, should the Clinical Analysis Laboratory created have all their attributes different (besides the types of test which can be the same) from any of the attributes of the already registed Clinical Analysis Laboratory or is any of the attributes allowed to be the same?"

*Answer: "Only the name of two CAL can be same."


*Question: "When starting a new clinical analysis laboratory registration, should the entered requested data be showed to the user for confirmation purposes?"

*Answer: "It is always a good practice to validate and ask for confirmation."


*Question: "Are the test types in US8 typed in or selected from those that the program has?"

*Answer: "The test types are selected from a list."



*Question: "Which type/format has LaboratoryID, address, name, phone number, and TIN number on Clinical Analysis Laboratory?"

*Answer: "Each Clinical Analysis Laboratory is characterized by the following attributes:
Laboratory ID: five alphanumeric characters;
Name: A string with no more than 20 characters;
Address: A string with no more than 30 characters;
Phone Number: 11 digit number;
TIN number: 10 digit number;
Type of tests performed by the lab.

All information is required." 


*Question: "Also, should we the employees be allocated to the clinical lab in which they work? Or, for example, can one medical lab technician work in more than one clinical analysis lab?"

*Answer: "Each Receptionist and each Medical Lab Technician can work in any Clinical Analysis Laboratory of the Many Labs network."


*Question: "We know through the specifications document that "All Many Labs clinical analysis laboratories perform clinical blood tests".
My question therefore is: When creating a new Clinical Analysis Laboratory, should the system automatically record that it operates that type of test or should the person who is creating it select it manually while selecting other types of tests? Or other option?"

*Answer: "The administrator should select, manually, all the types of tests to be performed by the Clinical Analysis Laboratory."



 


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

   AC1: All required fields must be filled in.
   AC2: Phone number needs to be 11 numbers.
   AC3: TIN needs to be 10 numbers.
   AC4: Name needs to have no more than 20 chars.
   AC5: Adress needs to have no more than 30 chars.
   AC6: Laboratory ID must have 5 alphanumberic. 

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

Dependency to "US9 Create new Type of Test" since one or more tests types must exist in order to state the type(s) of test(s) performed in a laboratory.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- Input Data
	- Typed data: Laboratory ID;
                      Name;
                      Address;
                      Phone Number;
                      TIN number.
	- Selected data: Type(s) of test(s)
- Output Data
        - List of Clinical Analysis Laboratory with test type selected
	- (In)Success of the operation

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Starts registering new Clinical Analisys Laboratory | ... interacting with the actor? | ClinicalAnalisysLaboratoryUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | ClinicalAnalisysLaboratoryController | Controller                             |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Lab? | RegisterClinicalStore | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Organization has a Task.   |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new RegisterClinicalStore? | Company | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Organization has a Task. |
| 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | UserSession  | IE: Knows the registered user and their roles.  |
| 			  		 |							 | Company  | IE: knows/has its own Employees|
| 			  		 |							 | Employee  | IE: knows its own data (e.g. email) |
| Step 2: Request Data | n/a							 | n/a            | n/a                             |
| Step 3: Types requested data |	... saving the input data? | ClinicalAnalisysLaboratory | IE: The object created in step 1 has its own data.                              |
| Step 4: shows type test list and asks to select one or more | ...knowing the test(s) type(s) to show? | TestType | IE: knows its own data |
| Step 5: select type(s) of test(s) | ... saving the selected Test Type? | ClinicalAnalisysLaboratory | IE: object created in step 1 has a method to add Testypes|
| Step 6: shows all data and requests confirmation |	...  validating the data locally? | ClinacalAnalisysLaboratory | IE: knows its own data |
| Step 6: shows all data and requests confirmation | ... validating the data globally? | RegisterClinicalStore | IE: knows all the ClinicalAnalysisLaboratory objects |                              |  
| Step 7: confirms the data | ... saving the created ClinicalAnalisysLaboratory | RegisterClinicalStore | IE: adopts/records all the ClinicalAnalysisLaboratory objects |                              |      
| Step 8: Informs operation success | ... informing operation success? | RegisterClinicalAnalisysLaboratoryUI | IE: responsible for user interaction |                              |                

### Systematization ##
